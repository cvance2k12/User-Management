PLEASE READ:

Project is ran on Replit. Until it is fully deployed, you can request to view the project at this Discord: https://discord.gg/repRKSv8.
Just leave any message and I'll turn on and run the User Management project and Discord bot that I made for that same server.

This is a smiple project for authenticating and managing users, granting them permission to post and delete their posts. 
The admin has the ability to ban the user or delete the posts, as well as create groups and permissions.
Tech Stack and Tools: HTML, Python, Django, Replit, Retool, PostgreSQL, Supabase
